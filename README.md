## PROJECT OVERVIEW

### PROBLEM STATEMENT

The current landscape of charitable donations is plagued by issues of transparency, inefficiency, and donor distrust. Traditional fundraising platforms often lack the mechanisms to provide real-time visibility into how donations are utilized, leading to concerns about mismanagement and misallocation of funds. This lack of transparency results in donor reluctance and hinders the potential impact of charitable initiatives. Furthermore, the existing systems are burdened with high operational costs and slow fund transfers, creating significant delays and reducing the overall effectiveness of the campaigns.

### SOLUTION

TokenGiver aims to address these critical issues by leveraging blockchain technology and token-bound accounts (ERC6551) to create a decentralized charity application. This platform will enable users to create and manage campaigns with full transparency, as every transaction will be recorded on the blockchain, providing an immutable and accessible record of donations and fund utilization. By allowing donors to send STRK tokens directly to the campaigns they support, TokenGiver ensures efficient and secure fund transfers, fostering greater trust and encouraging more contributions. This innovative approach will not only enhance the credibility of charitable campaigns but also maximize their impact, ultimately transforming the way charitable donations are managed and perceived.
